"""Background memory/skill review — fork the agent to evaluate the turn.

After every turn, ``AIAgent.run_conversation`` may call
:func:`spawn_background_review` to fire off a daemon thread that replays
the conversation snapshot in a forked :class:`AIAgent` and asks itself
"should any skill/memory be saved or updated?".  Writes go straight to
the memory + skill stores.  Main conversation and prompt cache are never
touched.

The fork inherits the parent's live runtime (provider, model, base_url,
credentials, cached system prompt) so it hits the same prefix cache and
uses the same auth.  It runs with a tool whitelist limited to memory and
skill management tools; everything else is denied at runtime.

See the ``hermes-agent-dev`` skill (``references/self-improvement-loop.md``)
for invariants and PR review criteria.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Auxiliary-model routing + context-budget helpers (cost reduction).
#
# The review fork historically ran on the parent's main model so it could
# reuse the parent's warmed system-prompt prefix cache (PR #17276). That is
# the cheapest path WHEN the user is on a cheap main model, but on an
# expensive reasoning model (gpt-5.5, opus) every review pays full price for
# the whole replayed transcript across up to 16 iterations.
#
# These helpers let a user route the review fork to a cheap aux model via
# ``auxiliary.background_review.{provider,model}`` (same plumbing as the
# curator and every other aux task). When routed OFF the parent model the
# prefix-cache share is dropped (different cache key) and the replayed
# context is trimmed to a digest, because the fork no longer benefits from
# matching the parent's cached prefix and we want its input bounded.

    "copied and modified (boilerplate configs, scaffolding, a "
    "known-good example the agent can `reproduce with modifications`).\n"
    "     • `scripts/<name>.<ext>` — statically re-runnable actions "

    "pattern, not the original failure.\n"
    "  • One-off task narratives. A user asking 'summarize today's "
    "market' or 'analyze this PR' is not a class of work that warrants "
